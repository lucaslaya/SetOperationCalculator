## Description
This is a class project made for CS1800. It's a simple calculator with multiple GUI's for the following set operations: <br />
-Union <br />
-Intersection <br />
-Complement <br />
-Difference <br />
-Symmetric Difference <br />
-Power Set <br />
-Cartesian Product <br />

## Installation
Runs on Python3 <br />
<br />
This program uses three python libraries that may have to be installed through pip. <br />
### Tkinter & Itertools
Both of these packages are included with Python3 on most platforms. 
### Pillow
Pillow is an image processing library. To install run the following command:
```
pip install pillow
```

## Usage
Run main.py <br />
The calculator is fairly simple to use just follow the instructions output in console to pick a calculator mode. Once in the desired GUI simply input your values in the bars at the top. The answers for each operation are displayed under the diagrams explaining the calculation. For ease of viewing all of the answers are also output to the console. To close just simply close the GUI window.

## Acknowledgements
Thank you so much to Don Rozenberg for creating PAGE. [PAGE](http://page.sourceforge.net/) is a GUI code generator I used for easily positioning items on the GUI. Most of the initialization code has been changed but this saved a lot of time.
